Chapter 11 - All about profile pages and Avatars

## About Profile pages

Profile pages are a crucial part of any software application. A profile page allows a user to interact with their personal information as they please. Use the [lesson](https://www.bolderlearner.com/admin/program/SoftwareEngineering/advanced/Flask%20%26%20Python:%20Full-stack%20Web%20Development/2018-edition/chapter-11 )to learn more.

## Migrations
Migrations are a major part in making profiles because they help to update your database so that avatars, usernames and passwords are remembered.
```bash
flask db migrate -m 'user table'
```
```bash
flask db upgrade
```
